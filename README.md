# PHP: Trim whitespace in multiline text

A function that removes leading and trailing whitespace in multiline strings, collapses multiple spaces and removes blank lines.

-   Written with a focus on basic minifaction of HTML content, especially content generated by templating engines, CMSes etc.
-   Tested to be as fast as possible (local test only; see `test/speed.php`).

## Usage

```php
// With default options
$trimmed = trimWhitespace($source);

// With custom options
$trimmed = trimWhitespace($source, [
    'leading' => false,
    'blankLines' => 2
]);
```

## Options

-   `leading` (bool, `true`): should we trim leading whitespace?
-   `inside` (bool, `true`): should we collapse spaces within a line (not leading whitespace)?
-   `blankLines` (int, `0`): max number of consecutive blank lines; use false to disable.
-   `tabWidth` (int, `4`): number of spaces to use when replacing tabs.

## Limitations

If you use this on any string which has meaningful whitespace, you will lose information and perhaps break stuff. For example:

-   Preformatted text content in HTML (e.g. displayed with w `<pre>` tag).
-   Strings with meaningful whitespace in JS.

Processing a whole HTML page with this function might be okay in many situations, but itâ€™s not 100% safe. For HTML templating, this function is better suited for minifying fragments of HTML than a whole page.
